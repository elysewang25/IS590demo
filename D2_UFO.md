## Title of the Dataset:UFO Sightings

## Data Cleaning assessment
* Cleaning needs: This dataset contains several null values that are needed to be remove. Also, detailed descriptions are difficult to be valued, and the timestamp formates are vary.
* Hand coding/Hand editing statements: I'll need to delete a few rows if I want to make the whold dataset looks cleaner. Also, due to the fact that some of the required info is missed, I will have to manually find other datasets/data to fulfill my original design.
