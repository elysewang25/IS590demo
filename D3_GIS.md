## Title of the Dataset: US Geographical Data (original file name: cont48l010a.shp_nt00940)

## Data Cleaning assessment
* Cleaning needs: This dataset presents the GIS data of the US. Due to the fact that the data is provided by USGS, no specific cleaning assessment is needed so far. However, due to the complexity of the dataset and its special format, I will have to spend at least 10 more hours exploring this. In addition, since the file structure is a little bit special (a .shape file), I will have to read through it by using Jupyter Notebook. 
* Hand coding/Hand editing statements: I will need the exploration through the dataset since some of the values of the columns look a bit weird (like I'm still not quite sure about their format). Also, some of the column names are hard to be understood, so I'll probably change the names for clarity.
